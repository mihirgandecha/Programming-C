# C Projects

Welcome to my collection of C projects from this term. Here, you'll find a comprehensive showcase of my journey through the intricate world of C programming. Starting from the foundational aspects such as understanding C syntax and control flows, I've progressively tackled more complex topics including abstract data types and algorithm design. 

The projects are organised in reverse chronological order, with the most recent ones listed first. Each project not only reflects my growth in mastering the C language but also my commitment to applying theoretical concepts to practical, real-world problems.
