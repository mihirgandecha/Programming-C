Part 1 (60%) : QWERTY Keyboard
Some words (such as typewriter) can be typed using only the letters that appear on the top row of
characters on a ‘QWERTY’ keyboard.
Finish the function in toprow.c which, along with the main1.c, toprow.h and Makefile given, allow
you to decide whether a string contains only the characters qwertyuiop and QWERTYUIOP.
The driver file main1.c, toprow.h and the Makefile, are given and cannot be changed. You should
complete toprow.c making any changes that you like, such that both .c files can be compiled together
(and run correctly) without warnings.
Only submit you version of toprow.c - we will use our version of the other files. We will adapt our
version of main1.c to test your code with other, similar, examples.
without using size_t passing assertions:

int main(void)
{

   // We will use these, as well as other, similar examples
   // to test your code with.

   // typewriter
   assert(toprow("typewriter")==true);
   // Torque
   assert(toprow("Torque")==true);
   // Equity
   assert(toprow("Equity")==true);
   // empty string
   assert(toprow("")==true);

   // FLASH
   assert(toprow("FLASH")==false);
   // typewriters
   assert(toprow("typewriters")==false);
   // tip-top
   assert(toprow("tip-top")==false);

}

ONLY FILL FUNCTION bool toprow(const char s[])
