Part 2 (40%) : String Sub-Sequence
Complete the function subseq which returns the length of the longest subsequence that two strings share.
For instance, the strings firedoor and hundreds have the length 3 string red in common.
The driver file main2.c, subseq.h and the Makefile, are given and cannot be changed. You should
complete subseq.c making any changes that you like, such that both files can be compiled together (and
run correctly) without warnings.
Only submit your version of subseq.c - we will use our version of the other files. We will adapt our
version of main2.c to test your code with other, similar, examples.
